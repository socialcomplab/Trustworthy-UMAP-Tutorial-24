This repository contains all the material supporting the tutorial *Tutorial on Trustworthy User Modeling and Recommendation From Technical and Regulatory Perspectives*, held at ACM UMAP'24.

## Abstract
This tutorial provides an interdisciplinary overview about the topics of fairness, non-discrimination, transparency, privacy, and security
in the context of recommender systems. These are important dimensions of trustworthy AI systems according to European policies,
but also extend to the global debate on regulating AI technology. Since we strongly believe that the aforementioned aspects require
more than merely technical considerations, we discuss these topics also from ethical, legal, and regulatory points of views, intertwining
different perspectives. The main focus of the tutorial is still on presenting technical solutions that aim at addressing the mentioned
topics of trustworthiness. In addition, the tutorial equips the mostly technical audience of RecSys with the necessary understanding of
the social and ethical implications of their research and development, and of recent ethical guidelines and regulatory frameworks
